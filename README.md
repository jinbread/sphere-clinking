# Cube Synth

An interactive 3D audio-visual experience built with Three.js and Tone.js. This project creates a physics-based environment where spheres interact with each other and produce musical sounds through collisions and interactions.

## Features

- Interactive 3D physics simulation
- Real-time sound synthesis using Tone.js
- Drag and drop interaction with spheres
- Dynamic chord generation based on sphere movement
- Adjustable volume and octave controls
- Cartoon-style rendering with shadows and lighting

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Cannon.js for physics simulation
- Tone.js for audio synthesis
- React for UI components

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd cube
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

- Click the "Start Experience" button to initialize audio
- Drag the main sphere to create musical sounds
- Adjust volume and octave using the controls in the top-right corner
- Watch as the spheres interact with each other and create a unique audio-visual experience
